# 9.4 Write a program to read through the mbox-short.txt and figure out who has sent the greatest
# number of mail messages. The program looks for 'From ' lines and takes the second word of those lines as
# the person who sent the mail. The program creates a Python dictionary that maps the sender's mail address to
# a count of the number of times they appear in the file. After the dictionary is produced, the program reads
# through the dictionary using a maximum loop to find the most prolific committer.
